                        <p> I would like to feature people who have inspired me professionally. So many people are quitting their day jobs to pursue their dreams and I am in the process of interviewing folks for personal research in my own goals. I would like to post my interviews on this site as well.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to help people with my design and development services so i would also provide links to their sites.</p>
